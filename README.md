# Hello-World
this is an introductory exercise to learn how to correct use github

i've included more info about me. 
i really want to learn coding because its a combination of everything i love.
language, art, storytelling, science and math.
i've always been doing sales because i thought my coding would never be good enough to make a career out of it but i think now is the perfect time to proove that theory wrong
